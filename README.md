# New HSK Test Vocabulary 1-9
New HSK 3.0 standard was released last year! Old HSK 2.0 test has 6 levels (1-6), but new HSK 3.0 test has 9 levels (1-9). Also, the vocabulary in each level changed greately. I recommend this New HSK Test Vocabulary 1-9 app. The only app on Google Play covers the vocabulary of 1~9 level (11,500+ words).
